Learn how to use SQL to store, query, and manipulate data. SQL is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data in a relational database, and is used by a huge number of apps and organizations.

# Create tables
CREATE TABLE groceries (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, quantity INTEGER);

# Inserting data
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (1, "Bananas", 4);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (2, "Peanut Butter", 1);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (1, "Dark chocolate bars", 2);

# Querying data
SELECT * FROM groceries;
SELECT books FROM groceries;
SELECT * FROM groceries ORDER BY aisle;
SELECT * FROM groceries WHERE aisle > 5 ORDER BY aisle; # Filter using where

# Aggregating data - Max, min, sum and avg
SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM groceries;
# To display the total number of items in each aisle.
# We add it to the end of the query
SELECT aile, SUM(quantity) FROM groceries GROUP BY aisle; # It first does the grouping, then calculates the sum
